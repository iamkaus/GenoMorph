# V1 -> Genome Structure Engine

## Responsible for:
- Region layout
- Coding vs non-coding distinction
- AT/GC bias [we either use markov chaining or sliding window manipulation]
- Region length distributions
- Strand
- Reading frame (coding only)

## Not responsible for:
- Translation
- Protein domains
- Functional annotation
- TF binding
- Epigenetics beyond mutation scaling
